LONDINIA is a contemporary Roman typeface with clear, open shapes, a generous x-height, and streamlined serifs. The typeface includes small serif-shaped cutaways and subtle incisions that give a lift to congested corners.

Each of the three weights of Londinia is accompanied by a complimentary italic.
